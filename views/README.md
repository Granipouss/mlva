# MLVA Website's Views

This directory contains all JavaScript sub-applications. Those views are like single page website, it allows the website to be very reactive.

You can build them using the npm scripts `npm run dev` and `npm run build`.

If you create a new view, think about editing `webpack.config.js` to make it build in the `public/dist` directory under an unused name.
